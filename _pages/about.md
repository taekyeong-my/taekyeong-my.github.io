Hello there! I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the interdisciplinary research department Migration, Integration, Transnationalization at the Berlin Social Science Center (WZB). Before that, I was a PhD researcher at the European University Institute. I hold Master’s degrees from the London School of Economics (LSE) and Freie Universität Berlin.

Currently, I am part of the collaborative project “Unequal Trajectories: Spatial Dynamics in Refugees’ Multidimensional Integration” (<a href='https://unetra.wzb.eu'>UneTra</a>) at the WZB, conducted jointly with the Leibniz Institute for Educational Trajectories (LifBi) and the Institute for Employment Research (IAB). The project investigates how residential environments and mobility shape the integration of refugees in Germany since 2013.

In my PhD dissertation, I examined the impact of digitalised forms of social relations on social cohesion. Specifically, I investigated the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on social networks and loneliness, as well as gender status bias in video conferencing interactions. My research combines both quantitative and qualitative methods.
